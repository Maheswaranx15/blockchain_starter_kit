## Limit Orders in Uniswap v3
    
Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs), where limit orders sit in an order book, Uniswap v3 achieves limit order functionality using its concentrated liquidity model. This means:

Placing a Limit Order:

A user provides liquidity in a very narrow price range (essentially placing all liquidity at a specific price).
If the market price reaches this range, the liquidity is used for swaps, effectively executing a limit order.
The user can withdraw the remaining liquidity once the order is filled.
How It Works Mechanically:

The user deposits token A in a specific price range.
If the price reaches that range, token A is swapped for token B.
The user can then withdraw token B, effectively executing a limit sell or buy order.
How to Clone This Functionality
If you want to replicate Uniswap v3's limit order feature, you need to implement the following:

1. Use Concentrated Liquidity Model
Implement non-fungible liquidity positions (like Uniswap v3â€™s NFTs).
Allow users to specify a price range for liquidity.
2. Auto-Execution Mechanism
Use a keeper bot (or a backend service) to monitor price changes.
When the price hits the limit range, trigger removal of liquidity and allow users to claim the converted token.
3. Frontend Integration
Allow users to choose a price to "place limit order" instead of a simple swap.
Show the estimated execution range.
