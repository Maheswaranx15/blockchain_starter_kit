1. Introduction to Uniswap V4
Objective: Set the context and explain what’s new in Uniswap V4.

Key Points:

Uniswap V4 builds on the success of V3, introducing hooks, singleton contract architecture, and customizable pools.

It’s designed to be more gas-efficient and flexible for developers.

Real-Life Example:

Compare Uniswap V4 to a modular kitchen. In V3, you had fixed appliances (pools), but in V4, you can customize your kitchen (pools) with hooks (additional features like dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, etc.).

2. Core Concepts of Uniswap V4
Explain the following concepts with examples:

a. Singleton Contract Architecture
What it is: All pools are managed under a single contract, reducing deployment costs and improving efficiency.

Real-Life Example:

Think of it like a shopping mall. Instead of having separate stores (pools) with their own management (contracts), everything is managed under one roof (singleton contract), making it easier to maintain and cheaper to operate.

b. Hooks
What they are: Hooks are external contracts that allow developers to customize pool behavior at key points (e.g., before/after a swap, LP position modification).

Real-Life Example:

Hooks are like smart home devices. You can program your lights (pools) to turn on/off (execute logic) based on certain conditions (e.g., time of day, motion detection).

c. Customizable Pools
What it is: Pools can now have unique features like dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, or TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles.

Real-Life Example:

Compare it to Netflix profiles. Each profile (pool) can have its own settings (features) tailored to the user’s preferences (specific use cases).

d. Flash Accounting
What it is: Instead of transferring tokens between accounts during swaps, Uniswap V4 uses internal accounting to reduce gas costs.

Real-Life Example:

Imagine a tab system at a bar. Instead of paying for each drink (token transfer) immediately, you run a tab (internal accounting) and settle it at the end (final transfer).

3. Main Contracts in Uniswap V4
Break down the key contracts and explain their roles with examples:

a. Singleton Contract
Role: Manages all pools in one contract.

Real-Life Example:

Think of it as a centralized HR system in a company. Instead of each department (pool) having its own HR (contract), everything is handled by one central HR system.

b. Pool Manager Contract
Role: Handles the creation and management of individual pools.

Real-Life Example:

It’s like a property manager for an apartment complex. The manager (Pool Manager) oversees each apartment (pool) and ensures everything runs smoothly.

c. Hooks Contract
Role: Allows developers to add custom logic to pools.

Real-Life Example:

Hooks are like plugins in a CMS (Content Management System). You can add features (hooks) to your website (pool) without changing the core system.

d. Flash Accounting Contract
Role: Handles internal token accounting to reduce gas costs.

Real-Life Example:

It’s like a credit card statement. Instead of paying for each purchase (swap) individually, you accumulate charges (internal accounting) and pay once at the end of the month (final transfer).

4. Interfaces in Uniswap V4
Explain the key interfaces and their purposes:

a. IPoolManager
Purpose: Provides functions to interact with pools (e.g., create, modify, swap).

Real-Life Example:

It’s like a remote control for your TV (pool). You use it to change channels (swap), adjust volume (modify fees), or turn it on/off (create/close pools).

b. IHooks
Purpose: Defines the methods for custom logic (hooks) to be executed at specific points.

Real-Life Example:

It’s like a recipe book for a chef (pool). The chef follows the recipe (hook logic) to prepare a dish (execute swap logic).

c. IERC20
Purpose: Standard interface for ERC-20 tokens used in swaps.

Real-Life Example:

It’s like a standardized shipping label for packages (tokens). Every package (token) follows the same format (interface) to ensure smooth delivery (transfers).

5. Real-Life Use Cases
Dynamic Fees:

Example: A toll road (pool) that adjusts fees based on traffic (market conditions).

On-Chain Limit Orders:

Example: A vending machine (pool) that only dispenses snacks (tokens) when the price is right (limit order condition).

TWAP Oracles:

Example: A weather station (pool) that provides average temperatures (prices) over time for accurate forecasting (trading strategies).

6. Interactive Session
Hands-On Activity:

Walk through a simple example of creating a pool with hooks using a testnet.

Q&A:

Encourage questions and discussions on how they might use Uniswap V4 in their projects.

7. Conclusion
Summarize the key takeaways:

Uniswap V4 is more gas-efficient and flexible.

Hooks enable endless customization.

Singleton architecture simplifies management.

End with a forward-looking statement: Uniswap V4 opens the door for innovative DeFi applications, and the community will drive its evolution.
